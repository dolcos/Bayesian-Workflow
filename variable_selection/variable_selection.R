#' This notebook includes the code for the Bayesian Workflow book
#' Chapter 28 *Models for regression coefficients and variable
#' selection: Student grades*.
#'
#' # Introduction
#'
#' We work with an example of predicting mathematics and Portuguese
#' exam grades for a sample of high school students in Portugal
#' [@Cortez-Silva:2008]. The same data was used in Chapter 12 of
#' Regression and Other Stories book [@Gelman-Hill-Vehtari:2020] to
#' illustrate different models for regression coefficients .
#'
#' We predict the students' final-year median exam grade in
#' mathematics (n=407) and Portuguese (n=657) given a large number of
#' potentially relevant predictors: student's school, student's sex,
#' student's age, student's home address type, family size, parents'
#' cohabitation status, mother's education, father's education,
#' home-to-school travel time, weekly study time, number of past class
#' failures, extra educational support, extra paid classes within the
#' course subject, extra-curricular activities, whether the student
#' attended nursery school, whether the student wants to take higher
#' education, internet access at home, whether the student has a
#' romantic relationship, quality of family relationships, free time
#' after school, going out with friends, weekday alcohol consumption,
#' weekend alcohol consumption, current health status, and number of
#' school absences.
#'
#' # Variable selection
#'
#' If we would care only about the predictive performance, we would
#' not need to do variable selection, but we would use all the
#' variables and a sensible joint prior. Here we are interested in
#' finding the smallest set of variables that provide similar
#' predictive performance as using all the variables (and sensible
#' prior). This helps to improve explainability and to design further
#' studies that could include also interventions. We are not
#' considering causal structure, and the selected variables are
#' unlikely to have direct causal effect, but the selected variables
#' that have high predictive relevance are such that their role in
#' causal graph should be eventually considered.
#'
#' We first build models with all predictors, and then use projection
#' predictive variable selection [@Piironen+etal:projpred:2020;
#' @McLatchie+etal:2025:projpred_workflow] implemented in R package
#' [`projpred`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=projpred). We also
#' demonstrate use of subsampling LOO with difference estimator
#' [@Magnusson+etal:2020:bigloocomparison] to speed-up model size
#' selection.

#' # Piranha theorem
#'
#' The common proper prior choice for coefficients is independent wide
#' normal prior. Piranha theorem states that it is not possible that
#' all predictors would be independent and have large coefficients at
#' the same time [@Tosh+etal:2024:piranha]. Thus when we have many
#' predictors we should include prior information that not all
#' coefficients can be large. One option is simply to divide the
#' normal prior variance with the number of predictors which keeps the
#' total variance constant (assuming the predictors are
#' normalized). Other option is to use more elaborate joint priors on
#' coefficients.
#'
#' # Implied priors on $R^2$ and R2D2 prior
#'
#' In regression analysis cases we might assume that data is noisy and
#' it is unlikely that we would get almost perfect fit. We can measure
#' the proportion of variance explained by the model with $R^2$.  To
#' understand what is the implied prior on $R^2$ given different
#' priors on coefficients, we can simply sample from the prior and
#' compute Bayesian $R^2$ using the prior draws.  The Bayesian-$R^2$
#' depends only on the model parameters, and thus can be used without
#' computing residuals that depend on data.
#'
#' If we have some prior information about $R^2$ we can use R2D2 prior
#' [@Zhang+etal:2022:R2D2] to first define a prior directly on $R^2$,
#' and then the prior is propagated to coefficients so that despite
#' the number of predictors the prior on $R^2$ stays constant. As
#' $R^2$ depends also on the residual scale, R2D2 prior is a joint
#' prior on coefficients and residual sigma.
#'
#' Although we can fit models with uniform prior on coefficients and
#' get proper posterior, we can't sample from improper unbounded
#' uniform prior. Thus, in the following we consider only models with
#' proper priors. For all the following models we use normal+(0, 3)
#' prior (where normal+ indicates normal distribution constrained to
#' be positive) for residual scale sigma, which is very weak prior as
#' the standard deviation of the whole data is 3.3. We use four
#' different priors for coefficients:
#'
#' 1. Independent normal(0, 2.5) prior which is a proper prior used as default by
#'    `rstanarm` and considered to be weakly informative for a single
#'    coefficient.
#' 2. Independent scaled normal prior. If we assume that many
#'    predictors may each have small relevance, we can scale the
#'    independent priors so that the sum of the prior variance stays
#'    reasonable. In this case we have 26 predictors and could have a
#'    prior guess that proportion of the explained variance is near
#'    $0.3$. Then a simple approach would be to assign independent
#'    priors to regression coefficients with mean $0$ and standard
#'    deviation $\sqrt{0.3/26}\operatorname{sd}(y)$.
#' 3. Regularized horseshoe prior [@Piironen+Vehtari:2017:rhs] which
#'    is a joint prior for the coefficients depending also on the
#'    residual scale, and it can be used to define sparsity assuming
#'    prior with the expected number of relevant coefficients. Here we
#'    guess that maybe 6 coefficients are relevant and set the global
#'    scale according to that. The result is not sensitive to the
#'    exact value for the prior guess of the number of relevant
#'    coefficients as it states just the mean for the prior. Regularized
#'    horseshoe has good prior predictive behavior when more variables
#'    are added.
#' 4. R2D2 prior, which has the benefit that it first defines the
#'    prior directly on $R^2$, and then the prior is propagated to the
#'    coefficients. The R2D2 prior is predictively consistent, so that
#'    the prior on $R^2$ stays constant as the number of predictors
#'    increases. We assign the R2D2 prior with mean 1/3 and precision
#'    3, which corresponds to the $\Beta(1,2)$ distribution on $R^2$
#'    implying that higher $R^2$ values are less likely. We set the
#'    concentration parameter to 1/2, which implies we assume some of
#'    the coefficients can be big and some small. R2D2 prior implementation
#'    in `brms` assumes the predictors have been standardized to have
#'    unit variance.

#' priors imply relatively flat prior on $R^2$. Regularized horseshoe
#' prior implies prior favoring values near 0. Looking at the implied
#' priors on the whole range can be misleading, and what is more
#' important is what is the behavior of the priors where the
#' likelihood is not very close to 0. Subplot b) shows the implied
#' priors on $R^2$ in a shorter range, and subplots c) and d) show
#' posterior-$R^2$ and LOO-$R^2$, respectively in the same range. Wide
#' normal prior favors larger $R^2$ values which then pushes the
#' posterior towards higher $R^2$ values and makes the model ovefit
#' which causes LOO-$R^2$ to be lower than with priors that do not
#' favor higher $R^2$ values. Scaled normal, regularized horseshoe and
#' R2D2 priors all slightly favor smaller $R^2$ values, which is a
#' sensible prior assumption, and the posterior have not been pushed
#' towards higher $R^2$ values. LOO-$R^2$ results are quite similar
#' with scaled normal, regularized horseshe and R2D2 priors, although
#' with regularized horseshe and R2D2 priors there is slightly less
#' uncertainty. Regularized horseshoe is favoring smaller $R^2$ values
#' more than scaled normal and R2D2, but as the likelihood has thinner
#' tail towards smaller $R^2$ values (is more informative in that
#' direction) there is not much difference in the posteriors.
#'
#' Although in this case scaled normal, regularized horseshoe, and
#' R2D2 all produce quite similar $R^2$ results, in general we favor
#' R2D2 prior as it is easiest to define the prior on
#' $R^2$. Regularized horseshoe can be easier to define when our prior
#' is about the sparsity in the coefficients. We now continue with the
#' R2D2 prior.
#'
#' In addition of LOO-$R^2$ shown above, we can compare LOO estimated
#' expected log predictive scores. With R2D2 prior the predictive
#' performance is better than with wide normal prior with probability
#' 0.94. The difference to scaled normal and horseshoe prior is
#' smaller.

#' is not that bad, we now continue with it.
#'
#' # Projection predictive variable selection
#'
#' We use projection predictive variable selection implemented in
#' `projpred` R package to find the minimal set of predictors that can
#' provide similar predictive performance as all predictor jointly.
#' By default `projpred` starts from the intercept only model and uses
#' forward search to find in which order to add predictors to minimize
#' the divergence from the full model predictive distribution.
